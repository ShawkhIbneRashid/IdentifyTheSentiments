# IdentifyTheSentiments
This problem statement for this sentiment analysis project can be found in https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/linguipedia-codefest-natural-language-processing-1/. To solve the problem I have applied different techniques which can be found in the .ipynb file. I have extracted different new features like total number of words, characters, stop words for each tweets. I have also removed URLs from those tweets, converted all characters from tweets as lowercase characters, removed 10 most occurring words, 10 least occurring words and stop words from each tweet. later I converted all the words in their base forms. After these pre processing and features extraction steps I have converted tweets in tfidf features with constraint of max number of features set to 10000. I have concatenated previous extracted features with these tfidf features and fed them to a multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the output for the test cases which gave an accuracy score of .8857 for this binary classification problem. Finally I created a .csv file with predicted 0 or 1 result. Here 0 is considered as positive and 1 as negative review.
